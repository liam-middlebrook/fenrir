### GLEW
In order to use Fenrir, GLEW (openGL Extension Wrangler) must be present.
For now GLEW must be extracted onto the C:\ drive of the development machine,
such that a directory `C:\glew-1.10.0\` will exist.
Once you have extracted the GLEW files into that directory you must copy over the DLL files that are required to run GLEW.
